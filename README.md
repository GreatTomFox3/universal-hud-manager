- **Basic performance** - Minimal impact during normal gameplay (not extensively tested)

## üöÄ Installation

**Development Build:**
1. No stable releases yet - build from source only
2. Place the generated `.jar` file in your `mods/` folder
3. Launch Minecraft with Forge 1.20.1-47.3.0 or later
4. **Performance**: Basic optimization, may have some impact during gameplay
5. **Compatibility**: Limited testing with other mods, use with caution

**Build from Source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GreatTomFox3/universal-hud-manager.git
cd universal-hud-manager
./gradlew build
```

## üéØ How to Use

### Config-based Position Control
1. **Edit Mode**: Press `H` key to view edit interface (visual only, no editing functionality)
2. **Configuration**: Edit `config/universalhudmanager-client.toml` manually for positioning
3. **File-based Updates**: Config changes apply after game restart or reload
4. **Pixel Precision**: Manual adjustment with 1-pixel accuracy through config editing

### Advanced Configuration
- **Config File**: `config/universalhudmanager-client.toml`
- **Vector2i Positioning**: Precise X,Y coordinate control for each element
- **Enable/Disable Control**: Individual HUD elements can be toggled on/off
- **Vanilla Position Manager**: Automatic position calculation for perfect Vanilla integration

### What Currently Works
- **Basic HUD Elements**: Position control for main Vanilla HUD components via config
- **Some Resource Pack Support**: Works with tested texture packs (compatibility not guaranteed)
- **Basic Performance**: Minimal impact during normal gameplay (limited testing)
- **Multi-state Support**: Basic positioning for different game scenarios (horse riding, underwater, etc.)

### Configuration Examples
```toml
[hud_positions]
health_position = [0, 0]        # Default Vanilla position
food_position = [-8, 0]         # 8 pixels left from Vanilla
experience_position = [1, 0]    # 1 pixel right for perfect alignment
air_position = [-8, 0]          # Matches food bar positioning
hotbar_position = [0, 0]        # Centered Vanilla position

[hud_enabled]
health_enabled = true
food_enabled = true
experience_enabled = true
air_enabled = true
hotbar_enabled = true
```

## üîß Development

### Technical Achievements

#### IDE-Based Development
Universal HUD Manager was developed using **IntelliJ IDEA environment** with Claude Code assistance:

- **Minecraft source access**: Analysis of Minecraft's HUD rendering through IDE environment
- **Mapping file reference**: Field name resolution using MCP ‚Üî SRG name mappings
- **Vanilla implementation study**: Attempted reproduction of Minecraft's HUD behavior
- **Development debugging**: Analysis of HUD positioning and rendering through IDE tools

#### Current Architecture
- **Vanilla Position Manager**: Coordinate calculation system that attempts to replicate Minecraft's positioning
- **Resource Pack Compatibility**: Basic rendering system that works with some texture modifications
- **Multi-state HUD Management**: Basic handling of different game states (horse riding, underwater, etc.)
- **Performance Considerations**: Attempts to minimize rendering overhead (limited testing)
