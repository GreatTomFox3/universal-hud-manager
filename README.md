```toml
[hud_positions]
health_position = [0, 0]        # Default Vanilla position
food_position = [-8, 0]         # 8 pixels left from Vanilla
experience_position = [1, 0]    # 1 pixel right for perfect alignment
air_position = [-8, 0]          # Matches food bar positioning
hotbar_position = [0, 0]        # Centered Vanilla position

[hud_enabled]
health_enabled = true
food_enabled = true
experience_enabled = true
air_enabled = true
hotbar_enabled = true
```

## 🔧 Development

### Technical Achievements

#### IDE Environment Revolution
Universal HUD Manager pioneered a revolutionary development approach using **IntelliJ IDEA environment integration** with Claude Code:
